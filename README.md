Welcome to BioMatrix! It is an app that allows users to quiz themselves on a variety of biology questions! This app allows various functionalities!

The android+ios version can be found here (still in progress): https://github.com/Eesha-Jain/BioMatrix

## General Features
On this app, you are allowed to answer questions based on different timers and then star questions you would like to review again. Additionally, each question is marked under a particular topic. If you often miss a certain category, that is a great indication for you to explore and learn more!

## Saving Progress
This app will continue to save your starred questions so that when you come back to the app, you can revisit questioned starred previously. You can also unstar them if you would like to remove them from your starred questions.

## Rounds
There are 3 different types of rounds you can select:
- Turtle Round: This allows you to answer questions without any timer
- Timer Round: This allows you to answer questions within 22 seconds
- Speed Round: This allows you to answer questions within 7 seconds

## Coins + App Themes
By answering a question correctly, you can gain a certain number of coins (depending on which round you are playing). When you answer a question incorrectly, you lose 5 coins. 

New app themes unlock as you gain coins! For example, Fall unlocks at 20 coins. You can change your theme with the avaliable options as often as you'd like! Your theme will save as you close and reopen the app.

#### Note: Currently, this app cannot be found on the app store yet.
