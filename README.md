# BioMatrix
Welcome to BioMatrix! It is an app for iOS phones that allows users to quiz themselves on various biology questions! This app allows various functionalities!

## General Features
On this app, you are allowed to answer questions based on different timers and then star questions you would like to review again. Additionally, each question is marked under a particular topic. If you often miss a certain category, that is a great indication for you to explore and learn more!

## Saving Progress
This app will continue to save your starred questions so that when you come back to the app, you can revisit questioned starred previously. You can also unstar them if you would like to remove them from your starred questions.
